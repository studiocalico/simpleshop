== Simple Shop

The Simple Shop is open for business! The shop doesn't really concern itself with looking pretty, or even having a user interface at all - it's all about the data model. The shop keeps track of Users, Products, and Orders, and has some simple service objects in <tt>app/actions</tt> for the order lifecycle.

Orders start out with status <strong>cart</strong> before the user checks out. When the order is placed, the status is changed to <strong>active</strong> and various important money amounts are also set.
